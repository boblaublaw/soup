# soup

Soup, as in alphabet soup.

This repo was formerly my own attempt to code an [autogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogram "Autogram page on Wikipedia")
 solver.

More recently, I learned of [Sentient Lang](https://sentient-lang.org/) and decided to write a simple python wrapper for the [solver provided in their examples](https://github.com/sentient-lang/sentient-lang.org/blob/gh-pages/examples/self-enumerating-pangram.snt).

To use soup.py, you will need to install
 * Python
 * Sentient Lang's main compiler "sentient"
 * The [Riss](https://sentient-lang.org/solvers/riss) SAT solver & optimizer
 * The [Lingeling](https://sentient-lang.org/solvers/lingeling) SAT solver
